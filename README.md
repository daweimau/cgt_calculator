# CGT calculator

A silly helper notebook for calculating capital gains on stocks.

## Use case

Trading stocks is fairly straightforward to track manually. There are many reports available.

When stocks are sold, capital gains (or losses) become assessable.

Calculating the assessable gains can quickly become difficult, especially when holdings were acquired incrementally over time. Sales rarely occur in the same increments as those in which the stocks were originally bought. This makes tracing the gains difficult.

There are also various acceptable tax methodologies.

This is a script which takes a FIFO ('first in, first out') approach. It reads in your trades, and produces a readable report of capital gains (including 12 month 50% CGT discounted assessable gains).

# For serious users

This is a common task! There's nothing fancy in this repo - it was created mostly as a fun exercise. A great service that does this calc, and much more is available at https://www.sharesight.com/ . They have a free offering.
