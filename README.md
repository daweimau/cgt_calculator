# cgt_calculator

A silly helper notebook for calculating capital gains on stocks.

## Use case

Trading stocks is fairly straightforward to track manually. There are many reports available.

When stocks are sold, capital gains (or losses) become assessable.

Calculating gains can quickly become difficult, especially when holdings have been acquired in increments over time. Sales rarely occur in the same increments as those in which the stocks were originally bought.

This is difficult at best to track manually.

This is a script which takes in a record of trades and produces a readable report of gains (including 12 month 50% CGT discounted assessable gains).

# For serious users

This is a common task! There's nothing fancy in this repo - it was created mostly as a fun exercise. A great service that does this calc, and much more is available at https://www.sharesight.com/ . They have a free offering.
